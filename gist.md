# Regex Tutorial

This is going to be a breakdown on regex functions and descibing what it does.
## Summary

The specifics of one particular regex will be covered in this course. [a-z0-9_-] is the regular expression (abbreviated as regex). This expression using brackets will look for anything enclosed by them. We have the characters a-z0-9 -, which we shall explain to you here, inside the brackets. A-Z refers to the entire alphabet from letter A through letter Z since hyphens indicate a range between letters or integers. Take note of the lowercase letters that are used. This indicates that while we are within that range, we will look for lowercase letters. The next regex is 0-9, which refers to all numbers from 0 to 9. Anything containing a lowercase letter or a number from 1 to 9 will match this regex. The hyphen and underscore come last.
